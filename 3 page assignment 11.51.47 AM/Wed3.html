        <h1>Last Wednesday: Animal Crossing</h1>
        <p>After a busy <a href="Wed1.html">Wednesday</a>, I decided to relax by playing my Nintendo Switch. 
            My favorite game to pass the time is Animal Crossing New Horizons.</p>

        <h3>Playing a Day</h3>
        <p>I can spend hours playing a day in Animal Crossing due to there being things you can do for yourself in game.
            I like to customize my island within the game as well as making vacation homes for villagers.</p>
