        <p><a href="Wed3.html">Last Wednesday</a> My dog Hootie had an eye infection. I took her to the vet to get treated. The staff was very helpful and kept her calm during the exam.</p>

        <p>Hootie needed lots of medicine. I had to give her antibiotics and pain meds by mouth. 
            The tricky part was the eye drops and ointment around her eye.</p>
